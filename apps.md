## Protirus

- [GitHub io](https://protirus.github.io/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/protirus))

You will find a number of PowerShell Modules, scripts and helper sites I've built over on my work site.

## Utility

I originally built a Utility helper app back in 2015, it was to save time and automate some manual tasks I was doing on a weekly basis, each time a new function or purpose was needed I added it as another tab.

I've been an iOS developer for a number of years and wanted a real world case for building a Mac app so I ported this across.

The next logically step was to build a website which had the same functionality, it's a little rough around the edges but open to PRs.

As the original app was in VB.NET I thought it was time to port it to C# and re-write it as a WPF app, this is on-going.

## HEXtoObjCColor

- [Mac](https://github.com/AlexHedley/HEXtoObjCColor)

When developing iOS apps on the Mac I was converting HEX colours using online tools (added above too) and I thought it would be useful to make some plugins for [PopClip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/extensions/) and [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).

## iOS

I was looking for real world examples of apps to build
