### Volunteer Experience

Symantec Trusted Advisor (Endpoint Management - Workflow and ServiceDesk)

Jul 2017 – Present Volunteer

The “Trusted Advisor” designation is given to an elite group of Symantec Connect community members who voluntarily share their expertise and experience with the Symantec Connect Community. Trusted Advisors are identified in the community with a special badge and are the front line of support for community users. Trusted Advisors are not Symantec Corp. employees.
