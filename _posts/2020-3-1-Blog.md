When I knew I wanted to blog again I had to decide where, and how, I've rolled my own, I've used Wordpress but now as I love using markdown, and GitHub has the ability to host webpages it made sense to use those.

There are a number of options:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/)
- [docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/)

I've used *mkdocs* for application documentation and I'm in the process of migrating it to *docfx* but for this I wanted to try something new.

I found [jekyll-now](https://www.jekyllnow.com)([GitHub](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)) and it's a quick setup but I wanted a few extra features.

In this post I'll run through the changes I've made.

The [README.md](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/blob/master/README.md) is thorough but I'll run through it anyway.

Firstly fork the repo, rename it to your username i.e. `alexhedley.github.io`.

Next is configuring the i.e. `_config.yml`

Update `name`, `description` and then find an image you wish to use, add it to the `images` folder and update the `avatar`.

`avatar: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexHedley/alexhedley.github.io/master/images/alexhedley.png`

Next is the `footer-links`. Add any social media accounts you wish to show in the footer.

Next is the `url`, this can be amended if it isn't the default repo.
