[Build Light]() is a way to *display your IDE's build status using RGB LEDs and IoT devices!*

It's been built by [@praeclarum](http://twitter.com/praeclarum) on his [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/FrankKrueger) channel the last few sunday nights.

It's an ESP32 device running a mini web server that when connected to a set of RGB lights will toggle the colour from red (for a failed build) to green (for a successful build) in Visual Studio for Mac.
